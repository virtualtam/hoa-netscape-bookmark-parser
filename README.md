# hoa-netscape-grammar
Netscape Bookmark Lexer/Parser experiment using [Hoa\Compiler](https://hoa-project.net/En/Literature/Hack/Compiler.html)

This project aims at rewriting the [Netscape Bookmark Parser](https://github.com/shaarli/netscape-bookmark-parser)
used by [Shaarli](https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli) to import bookmarks from other services,
using a proper grammar instead of tedious file sanitizing and linear parsing.
